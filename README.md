# ShapeSegmentationPOP
This project attempts to use polynomial optimization for finding a global solution to shape segmentation. (For theoretical bakground refer to paper: A polynomial optimization framework for object detection using invariants)

The main script to be called is run_iterate.m which for the chosen number of times calls multiple_weights_fixing. This function in turn analyzes the input image and calls either write_Gams_levelset2 (for 4th degree polynomials) or write_Gams_levelset2_arplane.m (for 6th degree polynomials). These scripts in turn will create the appropriate vectors of monomials and coefficients in Gams format and call sparsePOP function (SparsePOP package needs to be set up and added to project path). SparsePOP runs an SDP solver (refer to the package's setting) and from it's returning values we'll get the coefficients of the curve that was fit. In the main code run_iterate calculates the Hauffdorse distance between what the coefficients of the curve draw and an image template. If the distance is larger/smaller than a threshold the curve is added as negative/posetive example by running script add_negative. This script in turn formulates an SDp problem (as explained in the paper) and writes the new calculated invariant constraint ina file that will be written by write_Gams_levelset2/write_Gams_levelset2_arplane scripts in the next round.
